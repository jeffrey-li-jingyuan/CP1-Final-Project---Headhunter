# Head Hunter - the game
https://github.com/jeffrey-li-jingyuan/CP1-Final-Project---Headhunter/blob/master/Headhunter-image
This is a game of a headless stickman figure collecting heads raining down from sky. The control involves keyboard direction keys as well as "a" and "d" key. Special thanks to Zeke Bogusky for providing the codes of walking for me, it was hard for me to figure it out. Michael Toren Daniel Shiffman's video tutorials helped a lot on the Sound part of this game.

## Summary
In this Head Hunter game the player would control the movement of the stickman with the left arrow key and the right arrow key, and change the length of the neck of the stickman with the up arrow key and down arrow key. The "a" and "d" keys are available, for changing the direction of the neck (the neck can tur 90 degrees).
This is also a sad story that this stickman can never get to hold the head: the head disappears once the neck touches the it, before a joyful cheer from the stickman who thinks it got the head.


## Component Parts

It includes using arrays and booleans for the "headrain" function and the head collection function. It also uses the loadSound function to play the joyful cheer.

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1: Write the code for basic walking action mechanics. Zeke Bogusky helped me a lot by providing me the actual walking code, with the attention to detail of foot lifting action during each step.
- Week 2: Write the basic code for headrain.(Heads falling down); Write the code for the neck extending.
- Week 3: Refine the code for headrain and neck extending, while add sound into the game.
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges
To figure out how to let heads falling down while increasing the amount of head was a challenge.
